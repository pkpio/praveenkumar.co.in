I am fun loving, Workholic (sort of ;)) and very talkitive.
Every one can confirm that I am a Gadget freak and that I like to do something new, different and challenging.
Moreover being a sociable person, I have many friends since I like to communicate with people and get aquainted with new interesting individuals.
I appreciate friendship and people around me. Everytime I do my best to  be straight, honest and principled person. However I'm bad in my own ways..Yeah...I'm very short tempered and sometimes a lazy bum!<br /><br />

<b>My childhood</b><br />
I was born on 26th Oct., '92 and raised in the beautiful of East godavari, Andhra Pradesh. I have done my schooling in 4 different schools. Minerva, Pratista, Vivekananda, and Gowtham Model. I know, Thats a pretty big list. But that gave me many friends! I just love them all. I then completed my 11th and 12th at IIT Study Circle, Popularly known as Chukka Ramaiah Coaching center, Hyderabad. There it is...my most nerdy life and the best support that my parents gave me and not to forget my Dad's sister, without whom all this wouldn't be possible<br /><br />
 
<b>Little about my family</b><br />
My father, Venkata Rao is a farmer (I'm so very much proud of him) and My mother, Veera Kumari is a House wife. I have one sibling, younger than me, Sravya and not to forget My grandma who live with us in the same house. And yeah, My Dad's bro. and his wife, though don't stay with us in the same house, they also mean alot to me!<br /><br />

<b>Life at IIT</b><br />
Here I'm at IITB today, majoring in Electrical Engineering. This is my 5th semester here. These 2 years at IIT has alot of impact on what I presently am. </div>

Honestly, I don't know how to keep things personal. If you are someone around me then I'm sure you will nothing new here :P<br />
When it comes to more personal stuff its the relationships comes first, okiee..if not for all...agree in a normal persons case :P. By now you might have guessed it, that I must have been into a relationship. I can't say you are wrong! I had a relationship and I still believe in them! and I luv to have a long term relationship!
