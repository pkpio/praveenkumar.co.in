<h2>Pocket Tanks</h2>
<div id="PocketTanksContent">
<h3 id="SubHeading">Idea:</h3>
To develop the classical Pocket Tank game using C++ and EzWindows library for GUI<br><br>

<h3 id="SubHeading">Developers:</h3>
We were working in a team of 13<br><br>

<h3 id="SubHeading">Development:</h3>
The game starts with a Random terrain generation on which the both the tanks are positioned. Our completed codes for different weapons and their effects and also codes for the tank orientation and position. However do to lack of sufficient time we could bundle our work into a single piece of working game. It was done as a part of our CS 101 course. If you know not how this game works, <a href="http://www.blitwise.com/ptanks.html" target="_blank">Check this link</a>
